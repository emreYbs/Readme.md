### A little info about me 🧑‍💻 

I am an instructor at a university and help my students with technical English. I try to improve myself on Python, natural language processing, and infoSec. BTW I am not a professional programmer. However, I have a strong desire to learn and improve everyday. I may switch careers soon. We need to be open-minded, learn constantly and flexible in life, don't we ❔  😊

I am a serious ameteur of these subjects:
* Cybersecurity  🛡️ *(Currently, CompTIA PenTest+, Security+, CEH v9, OSCP certified)*
* Osint :eyes:
* Natural language processing 🗣️   💬   
* Bugbounty  🐛
* Photography :camera_flash:
 
In short, I can say that I am a self-driven person who is actively looking for ways to contribute on open-source projects and this has led me to begin learning about programming, because of the fact that I have a sense of intellectual curiosity and a desire to learn everyday. That's why, I have begun to invest on my learning and help others as much as I can do.
